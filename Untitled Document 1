1. Avoiding obstacles

2. When distance lookahead is long, it doesn't widely overcorrect because no drastic measures needed for something so far ahead.
   If it is short, it follows the path much better, better avoiding hitting obstacles similarly because of no shortcuts, but ends up doing drastic manuvers to get back on path, esp. on straight line. 
   
   SOLUTION: Improve avoid obstacles and keep distance lookahead long?
